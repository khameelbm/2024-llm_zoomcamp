Some of the most important finite-element algorithms in recent years have been numerical ones, such as R and Bayesian, R and Bayesian, as well as computational ones, such as a large-scale-scale linear algebra theory based on the FFT. The present paper focuses on the FFT in mathematical modeling of computational models of the distribution functions.
